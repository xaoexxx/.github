## 🔑 Key Concepts

### xx Ecosystem
The eventual movement family of libraries, packages, and data structures designed for maximum security, AI intelligence, and cross-repository orchestration.

### EMS (ECMAScript Modules)
100% of xx code uses modern ES modules for compatibility, performance, and future-proofing.

### Validated Users
All access requires validation. Current users: Oktay (Owner), Rasmus (Learning).

### Maximum Security
Security-first architecture with encryption, audit logging, and permission-based access control.

### AI-Powered
Intelligent pre-organizing, prediction, and execution capabilities built into the core.

### Terminal-Like
Self-contained, efficient execution environment similar to terminal operations.

### Cross-Repository References
High-level abstracted codebase that references modules across all organizational repositories.
